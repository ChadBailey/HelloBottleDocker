# HelloBottleDocker

This repo is designed to give you a very easy to use framework to write a microservice using the bottle framework.

It includes the basic building blocks to get you up and running, along with shell scripts that take the guess work out of docker command syntax.

## Important Note

This is not intended to be ran in production as-is. At a minimum, this should be ran using a proper wsgi server such as gunicorn/uwsgi/bjoern/etc. Perhaps I'll enhance this project to include that at a later date.

Enjoy
